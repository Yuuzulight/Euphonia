"""Voice training analyzer 💗

Analyzes a recording with Praat (via parselmouth) and adds it to the dashboard.

Two layers of analysis run on every recording:
  1. Standard summary metrics (pitch, formants, voice quality, intensity) →
     appended to recordings.json for the permanent dashboard cards.
  2. Detailed register & phrasing analysis (frame-level F0 contour, register
     stability, silence-based phrase segmentation, per-phrase boundary
     behavior) → written to dashboard-react/public/analysis/<id>.json for the
     permanent "Register & phrasing" visualizer, plus a few headline numbers
     folded into the recording entry.

Usage:
    uv run analyze.py "/path/to/recording.mp3" --label "trying to be louder"
    uv run analyze.py "clip.wav" --label "pitch + bright resonance" --note "felt strained"
    uv run analyze.py "clip.wav" --label "..." --register-floor 130

recordings.json (repo root) is the source of truth. The React app in
dashboard-react/ reads everything from its public/ dir at runtime.

    """Vowel-nucleus-targeted F1/F2/F3 (median over vowel cores), in Hz.

    The old method averaged each formant over EVERY voiced frame, which folds in
    consonant transitions, glides, schwas and tracker mistracks — that compresses
    the signal so it barely separates the sexes (on VCTK: women's F2 mean 1639 vs
    men's 1566, only ~73 Hz apart). Resonance should separate them much better.

    Instead we gate to frames that are voiced AND vowel-like, then take the
    MEDIAN (robust to the outliers a mean drags in):
      1. **Voiced** — F0 present at the frame (pulled from the pitch track in one
         numpy shot, then subsampled to <=300 frames so cost is bounded on long
         clips; no per-bin Praat round-trips).
      2. **Loud** — within 10 dB of the clip's peak intensity. Vowel nuclei are
         the loud cores of syllables; consonants and glides are quieter.
      3. **Plausible vowel F1** — F1 in ~250–1000 Hz (real vowel-space range);
         rejects nasals/approximants and obvious mistracks.
      4. **Stable** — small frame-to-frame change in F2 (<= ~150 Hz vs its
         neighbour), so we keep the steady vowel core and drop transitions/glides
         where the tracker is sliding.

    From the surviving vowel frames we take the median F1, F2, F3. F1 uses the
    same gated set for consistency; F2/F3 are the focus (the real brightness cue).

    Ceiling note: `To Formant (burg)` uses a single max-formant ceiling
    (FORMANT_CEILING = 5500 Hz), tuned for a feminine/shorter vocal tract. On the
    reference MEN this can mistrack (their formants are lower; a 5500 ceiling can
    pack an extra spurious formant in). We measure twice — once at 5500 and once
    at a lower 5000 ceiling typical for longer (masculine) tracts — and pick the
    ceiling whose vowel-gated frames give the **tighter** (lower-spread) F2
    distribution, i.e. the cleaner track. This is applied uniformly to takes AND
    refs, so M/F stay comparable; it costs one extra Formant pass and no per-bin
    loops, so runtime stays bounded.
