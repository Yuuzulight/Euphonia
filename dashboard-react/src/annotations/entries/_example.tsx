/* ============================================================================
 * EXAMPLE / TEMPLATE — how to author a recording's annotations.
 *
 * This file is NOT rendered: the loader (../AnnotationsProvider) only loads
 * `entries/<NNN>.tsx` where <NNN> is a recording's zero-padded id (001, 002…).
 * Because this file is named `_example`, no recording id ever maps to it — it
 * exists purely as a copy-me reference. It still type-checks, so it can't rot.
 *
 * TO AUTHOR A REAL ONE: copy this to `entries/00N.tsx` (matching the recording's
 * id), then fill in only the slots you want. Everything you DON'T provide falls
 * back to the dashboard's built-in defaults — that's what keeps this DRY (the
 * page layout lives once; you only write the bespoke bits per take).
 *
 * The full workflow (run analyzer → interpret → author this file) is documented
 * in the `analyze-voice` skill (.claude/skills/analyze-voice/SKILL.md). Read it.
 * ========================================================================== */

import type { RecordingAnnotations } from "../types";
// Reusable building blocks. Grow this library (../lib) when an insight needs a
// new viz that could be reused — don't bury reusable charts in one entry.
import { InsightCard, Drill, PhraseEndingStrip, StatCompare } from "../lib";
import { fmt } from "../../zones";

/* Each slot is `(ctx) => ReactNode`, where ctx = { recording, detail }.
 * - recording: the full Recording (pitch/formants/voice_quality/intensity/
 *   weight/register summary). See ../types.ts.
 * - detail: the heavy per-frame/per-phrase analysis (frames, phrases, summary),
 *   loaded from public/analysis/<id>.json. May be null while loading — guard it.
 *
 * AVAILABLE SLOTS:
 *   Override notes (replace a built-in woven note; default shows if you omit it):
 *     note.pitch · note.loudness · note.resonance · note.register
 *   Freeform insertion regions (render nothing unless you fill them):
 *     region.top · region.afterLatest · region.afterResonance ·
 *     region.afterRegister · region.insights (the main one) · region.bottom
 *   Need a slot somewhere new? Add a <Note id> / <Region id> in the layout
 *   (App.tsx or a component) and document it here.
 *
 * CONVENTIONS (non-negotiable — see CLAUDE.md):
 *   Color rule: blue (MASC) = masculine / fell-out-of-register ONLY, never a
 *   generic "bad". pink (FEM) = good/feminine, butter = neutral, GROW = neutral
 *   "room to grow" for non-gendered skill gaps. Components use the automatic JSX
 *   runtime — do NOT import React. Tone: warm, specific, "a compass not a judge".
