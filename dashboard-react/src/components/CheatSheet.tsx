            folds, how they vibrate) from the <b>filter</b> (the shape of your
            throat &amp; mouth). A steeper roll-off — a <i>smaller</i> H1*–A3* —
            reads lighter &amp; more feminine; a flatter, larger value reads
            heavier. Gain-independent, so it's truly <i>comparable take-to-take</i>{" "}

            💗 To lighten: let the folds come together gently — easy, breath-flowy
            tone, never pressed or squeezed. Lighter is the reliable direction;
